# Debug Activity

* Don't just start fixing errors that you see. Run the application and use the information the error gives to find it and fix it.
* Read what the error message is saying and check the location of the error.
* Once the program runs completely make sure that the logic is working correctly as well. Just because it doesn't throw an error does not guarantee the logic is correct.
